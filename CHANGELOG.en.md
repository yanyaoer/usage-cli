Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## 0.1.11 — 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- `setup_app.py` now packages `usag_statusline.py` so the `.app` bundle ships the hook source.
- `setup_hook.py` now resolves the hook source in both source-tree mode and `.app` bundle mode.

### UI
- The popover now shows a one-click "立即安裝 hook" recovery button when the status file is missing.

## 0.1.10 — 2026-05-18

### UI
- Progress bars now change colour based on usage level: below 50% keeps the brand colour, 50–80% shifts to amber, ≥ 80% turns red.

### Fixed
- `codex_loader.py`: use last token-event timestamp for `hours_back` filtering; per-file fault-tolerant sort.
- `history_loader.py`: composite dedup key when id fields are absent; reject bool and negative token values.
- `usage_client.py`: guard `rate_limits` sub-fields against non-dict values.
- `setup_hook.py`: validate settings before writing; safely rebuild backup field if not a dict.

### Documentation
- README: corrected three factual inaccuracies (network claim, Codex data source, cost is an estimate).
- README: added Quick start table, Download the app section, and Troubleshooting table.

## 0.1.9 — 2026-05-18

### UI
- Progress bars now change colour based on usage level: below 50% keeps the brand colour (Claude orange / Codex cyan), 50–80% shifts to amber, ≥ 80% turns red.

### Fixed
- Sync status label changed from `usag-status` to `usage` to match the public-facing project name.
- `setup_hook.py`: wrap interpreter and hook paths with `shlex.quote()` so hooks work when the project directory contains spaces (PR #1, thanks @DennisWei9898).
- `usag_statusline.py`: replace `datetime.UTC` (Python 3.11+) with `timezone.utc` for compatibility with macOS system Python 3.9 (PR #1, thanks @DennisWei9898).
- `codex_loader.py`: use the last token-event timestamp for `hours_back` filtering so long sessions no longer drop recent tokens; per-file fault-tolerant sort so a single bad file doesn't break the entire session scan.
- `history_loader.py`: fall back to a composite dedup key when `message_id` / `request_id` is absent; reject bool and negative token values.
- `usage_client.py`: guard `rate_limits` and its sub-fields against non-dict values.
- `setup_hook.py`: validate `settings.json` structure before writing; safely rebuild the backup field if it is not a dict.

### Documentation
- README: replaced mainland Chinese phrasing ("打API", "打網路") with standard Taiwanese usage ("呼叫 API", "連網路").

## 0.1.8 — 2026-05-18

### UI
- Popover redesign:
  - Claude Code / Codex cards now show a branded icon in the header (`claude.webp` / `codex.webp`).
  - Card surfaces and progress fills switched to gradient (`NSGradient`); accent colours brightened (Claude leans warm orange, Codex leans cyan).
  - "Refresh now" and "Quit" buttons replaced with a custom `ActionButton` that draws primary / secondary styles (primary uses the accent gradient, secondary uses a translucent bordered fill).
  - Rate / status / today-cost line wrapped in its own card so the three sections share one visual language.
  - Spacing, weights, tracking, and muted colours re-tuned for stronger contrast in both Light and Dark Mode.

### Packaging
- `setup_app.py` declares `claude.webp` / `codex.webp` as py2app `resources` so the `.app` bundle ships the icons.
- `menubar.py` resolves icon paths via `NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource_ofType_`, so both the dev deployment (LaunchAgent runs `main.py` directly) and the `.app` bundle find the assets.

## 0.1.7 — 2026-05-18

### Documentation
- README now ships 5 badges (CI status, latest release, Python version, platform, license).
- README's "How it gets the data" section now includes a mermaid diagram visualizing the `Claude Code → hook → JSON file → usage` chain, with `Anthropic API` explicitly drawn as **never called** (dashed broken line).
- Added bilingual `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.en.md`: spells out what issues / PRs should include, the three checks required before merge, off-limits technical identifiers and UI constants, the bilingual CHANGELOG rule, and commit message style.

### Tests
- Added three new test files covering the three highest-risk "I/O / parse boundary" modules (previously zero coverage, the same class of code that produced the 0.1.2 → 0.1.3 "change one place, miss another" bug):
  - `tests/test_usage_client.py`: `_read_status_file` with both paths missing / `USAG_STATUS` bad JSON / fallback to TT_STATUS; `_build_snapshot` missing fields / percent out-of-range clamp; `ClaudeUsageClient` outcomes in mock and real mode.
  - `tests/test_codex_loader.py`: `load_entries` with missing sessions dir / valid JSONL / `hours_back` cutoff filter / bad JSON line / missing fields / `_parse_timestamp` across three ISO 8601 variants; `load_rate_limits` returns None when file missing / parses primary + secondary windows.
  - `tests/test_setup_hook.py`: `setup` in a clean env / existing custom statusLine gets backed up / idempotent on repeat; `unsetup` restores backup / behaves cleanly when never installed; `_is_usag_hook` discriminator.
- All tests use `monkeypatch` to redirect path constants; **real `~/.claude` and `~/.codex` are never touched** (verified by before/after mtime comparison).
- Test count: 44 → 60. Runtime: 0.04s → 0.08s.

## 0.1.6 — 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Public-facing name unified from `usag` to `usage`, matching the GitHub repo:
  - `pyproject.toml`'s `name` changed from `"usag"` to `"usage"` (so PyPI / `pip list` now show `usage`).
  - `README.md` / `README.en.md` headers and prose now say `usage`.
  - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` updated likewise.
- **Intentionally unchanged** (to avoid breaking existing installs): all file paths, settings keys, and binary names keep the `usag` prefix — `~/.claude/usag-status.json`, `~/.claude/usag-statusline.py`, `~/Library/Logs/usag/`, `com.lollapalooza.usag` (LaunchAgent label), `usag.app` (bundle), `USAG_DEBUG` (env var), `settings.usag.previousStatusLine` (JSON key) are all untouched. The technical short name is `usag`; the public name is `usage`.

## 0.1.5 — 2026-05-18

### CI
- Bumped `actions/setup-python` from v5 to v6 (v6 runs on Node.js 24). GitHub had been warning that v5 runs on Node.js 20 and the runner will force Node 24 after 2026-09-16; pre-empting the breakage.

### Documentation
- `pyproject.toml`'s `description` was rewritten from "在 macOS 終端機顯示 Claude Code 用量的繁中小工具" (terminal-only) to "usage — 在 macOS menu bar 顯示 Claude Code 用量的繁中小工具（也提供終端機 TUI）". The old description misrepresented the project as terminal-only; the new one reflects the menu-bar-first reality and aligns the displayed project name with the repo.

## 0.1.4 — 2026-05-18

### CI
- Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) is now self-healing: after a tag is pushed, if the matching GitHub release does not exist yet, the workflow first creates it via `gh release create` (empty notes, target set to the tag's ref) and then uploads `usag.app.zip`. The "workflow assumes release already exists, upload fails" trap hit during 0.1.3 won't recur.

### Build
- Tightened `menubar.py` mypy config from a blanket `# mypy: ignore-errors` to `disable-error-code="import-untyped,misc"`, which only suppresses PyObjC's missing stubs and dynamic base-class errors. Real type errors (the class of bug behind `tracker.sample`'s `AttributeError`) will now be caught.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Popover redesigned: Claude / Codex sections now sit in subtle inset cards, with refined spacing, font weights, and muted footer text. Card fill adapts to Dark / Light appearance.
- `docs/popover.png` updated to the new look.

### Fixed
- Live data no longer collapses to `--` with `狀態：錯誤 (AttributeError)`. The stale `self.tracker.sample(...)` call in `menubar.py` (left over from 0.1.2's `sample()` removal) raised `AttributeError` on every successful refresh; dropped the call. `tracker.group()` already reads history entries directly.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-05-17

### Changed
- `pricing.py`: pricing cache moved from the package directory to `~/.claude/pricing_cache.json` so the read-only `.app` bundle can refresh the cache.
- Applied `ruff format` across the project (formatting only; no logic changes).

### Removed
- `UsageRateTracker.sample()` dead code (was a no-op called from `main._apply_outcome`).

### Build
- `.gitignore` now excludes `*.egg-info/` and `.pytest_cache/`.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-05-17

### Added
- py2app `.app` bundle build config (`setup_app.py`, `build_app.sh`) so users can run usag without a terminal.
- GitHub Actions release workflow (`release.yml`) automatically builds `usag.app.zip` and attaches it to each tagged release.
- English README (`README.en.md`) and a language switcher at the top of both READMEs.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-17

First public release on GitHub.

### Added
- pytest test suite under `tests/` covering `pricing`, `history_loader`, and `usage_rate` (44 tests, 89% line coverage).
- CI runs `pytest -v` after ruff and mypy.
- GitHub Actions CI runs `ruff check` and `mypy` on push to main and pull requests (macos-latest runner, uv-managed deps).
- `USAG_DEBUG=1` environment variable enables warning-level logger output for the previously silent OSError sites.
- Issue templates (bug report, feature request) and pull request template under `.github/`.

### Changed
- `menubar.py`: I/O moved off the AppKit main thread (background `threading.Thread` + `performSelectorOnMainThread_withObject_waitUntilDone_`), eliminating the periodic UI freeze on each refresh tick. A `_refresh_in_flight` flag prevents re-entry.
- `usage_rate.py`: 30-second TTL cache for `group()`; stops re-scanning the last hour of JSONL on every TUI tick.
- `menubar.py`: divider lines re-centered between provider blocks (first_y=178, second_y=352). "今日" status line returned to 12pt to match the rest of the footer.
- README: use `python3` instead of `python` (the uv venv only ships the `python3` symlink); documented `USAG_DEBUG`.

### Fixed
- `setup_hook.py` and `pricing.py` use atomic writes (`tempfile.mkstemp` + `os.replace`); a crash mid-write no longer corrupts `~/.claude/settings.json` or `pricing_cache.json`.
- `install-launchagent.sh` uses `BASH_SOURCE` to resolve the project directory; previously broke when run from anywhere other than the project root.
- `uninstall-launchagent.sh` removes logs from `~/Library/Logs/usag/` (the actual location), not from the project directory.
- `pricing_cache.json` expires after 7 days based on mtime, so stale prices don't linger after a model price drop.
- Seven previously silent `except OSError` sites in `pricing.py`, `codex_loader.py`, and `history_loader.py` now log a warning before swallowing the error.

### Removed
- `blocks.py` — unused dead code.
